# Vision-Transformer
This repository implements the vision transformer model from the paper "An Image is Worth 16 x 16 Words"

# How To Run
There are two files named "ViT-Custom.py" and "ViT-Base.ipynb". 
"ViT-Custom.py" implements a fully custom vision transformer model.
"ViT-Base.ipynb" implements the vision transformer model using the tensorflow library layers. This is used as a reference point to test our custom implementation.
